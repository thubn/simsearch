# Benchmark
Launch the `benchmark_vs.py` file with python to start the benchmark. Look at `run_benchmark.sh` for examples. You probaply need to adjust the path to the parquet embedding files. You also need to have the `embedding_search_benchmark.so` library in the same folder or in your path. To get this library you need to build the main c++ project.

You can use the results to generate plots with the [jupyter notebook](../jupyter/)
